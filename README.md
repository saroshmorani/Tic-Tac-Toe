# Tic-Tac-Toe
# A straightforward two-player game, Tic-Tac-Toe involves players marking squares on a 3x3 grid with either a 'X' or a 'O'. Being the first person to receive three of their marks in a row—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal—is the goal. The goal of this project is to create a digital version of the game with an intuitive user interface. In addition to a multiplayer option where two players can compete, the game will feature a simple algorithm for single-player play against the computer. In order to improve scalability, the game will be created using C programme language and an object-oriented design methodology.
